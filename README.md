# Pig-Game-Desktop

Pig is a simple dice game that can be played with two or more players. The goal of the game is to be the first player to reach 100 points. To do this, players take turns rolling a die and adding the result to their score. However, if a player rolls a 1, their turn is over and they lose all of their points for that turn. The first player to reach 100 points wins the game.
